    <p>
The Society of Vacuum Coaters (SVC) was founded in 1957 as a forum for<br>
vacuum coating professionals, with a focus on decorative and optical<br>
coatings before evolving to encompass broader technologies like <br>
sputtering and ion plating. Its history reflects the expansion and <br>
development of vacuum coating technology from early decorative<br>
 applications in the 1950s to the sophisticated thin-film applications<br>
  in optics, electronics, and aerospace today. The SVC continues to <br>
host annual technical conferences (TechCons), providing an educational<br>
 and networking platform for the global vacuum coating community<br>
